# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to go through a JavaScript file with UFO sightings data and display it in a table. The table is able to be manipulated by users in a dynamic webpage. 

## Results
The webpage created lets users manipulate and filter data from the table to discover information about UFO sightings around different cities, states, and countries around the world. Users can enter a certain date and search for different types of sightings as well. 

## Summary
This webpage alouds users to filter data from UFO sightings quite easily. One drawback would be that a button for "Search Data" is missing. My recommendation would be to add that button. One other recommendation for further development will involve to have all filters inside the table (filtering each column), instead of having them as input. The "date" filter can be the only one left as input.
